The task of the OOP is to create a class of a snack machine with a certain functionality. **For example**: set the slot size, add a snack to the slot, add a slot to the vending machine, find out the number of empty positions, display the contents of the vending machine and so on. Each class is declared and implemented in the corresponding files (Snack, SnackSlot, vendingMachine).
