# Linear algorithyms

This folder contains some **linear** algorithyms (**asymptotic complexity O(N)**) and **solutions** of tasks using them.

*  [max.cpp](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/blob/main/Linear/max.cpp) - some functions to find the **maximum** of sequnce, two **max elements** and **non-even maximum**.

*  [max.h](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/blob/main/Linear/max.h) - declarations of functions from **max.cpp**

*  [island.cpp](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/blob/main/Linear/island.cpp) - solution of **"island"** task. We have island wich looks like a lot of columns joined together. It is raining over the island and we need to find out the "volume" of the pits filled with water.

*  [RLE.cpp](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/blob/main/Linear/RLE.cpp) - **RLE** transcoding of the input string
