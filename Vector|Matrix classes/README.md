# Vector and matrix classes

The task of the **OOP** is to create a **basic** vector and matrix classes. 

**Output** - results of some functions work and work of the overloaded operators.

Checking the operation of class functions, getters and setters, overloads of class operators. The work of most of them is in the project description above.

* [vector.h](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/new/main/Vector%7CMatrix%20classes/vector.h) - declaration of the vector class
* [vector.cpp](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/new/main/Vector%7CMatrix%20classes.vectorcpp) - implementation of the vector class with its functionality
* [matrix.h](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/new/main/Vector%7CMatrix%20classes/matrix.h) - declaration of the matrix class
* [matrix.cpp](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/new/main/Vector%7CMatrix%20classes/matrix.cpp) - implementation of the matrix class with its functionality
* [main.cpp](https://github.com/EjenY-Poltavchiny/CPLUS-practice/new/main/Vector%7CMatrix%20classes/main.cpp) - some functionality tests
